Wrong demonstration:
Parameter + image 1 + image 2 = overlay
Correct demonstration:
Parameter + image 1 = image 1 displayed in the overlay area
Parameter + image 2 = image 2 displayed in the overlay area
Image 1 displayed in the overlay area + image 2 displayed in the overlay area = the effect displayed in the overlay area
Implementation method

CSS positioning and blending mode:

Use absolute positioning to overlap two images in the same area
Use CSS opacity property to control transparency
Use CSS transform: translate(x, y) to achieve image offset
You can use CSS blending modes (such as mix-blend-mode) to achieve more complex overlay effects

Canvas API:

Use HTML5 Canvas draws and overlays images
Control transparency and position through JavaScript
More complex image processing and transformations can be achieved

React state management:

Use React state to store and update transparency and offset parameters
Re-render components when parameters change

Possible plugins/frameworks

Basic React:

Use React's state and effect hooks to implement basic functions
No special plugins are required to complete simple overlay effects

Image processing library:

react-image-overlay: React component specifically for image overlay
react-konva: Canvas encapsulation library, which facilitates image manipulation using Canvas in React
fab ric.js: Feature-rich Canvas operation library

UI control components:

react-slider or rc-slider: used to create sliders to control transparency

react-draggable: allows users to adjust image offsets by dragging

Overview of implementation steps

Create a container component and set it to relative positioning

Place two image components in the container and set it to absolute positioning
Add states to each image component to control its transparency and position
Add UI controls so that users can adjust these parameters
When users adjust parameters, update the state in real time and re-render the image

This method can achieve a completely real-time image overlay effect, and each parameter change will be immediately reflected in the display instead of generating a new composite image. Technology stack selection
React: As a basic framework, it is used to build componentized image display areas.
CSS: Used for basic positioning and overlay effects, especially using position: absolute or relative to achieve image stacking and offset.
Canvas API or WebGL: Used for real-time rendering of image overlay effects, especially when dynamic adjustment of transparency or more complex image processing is required.
2. Implementation ideas
Component design:
Create an ImageOverlay component to manage the display of two images.
Use two subcomponents (such as ImageLayer1 and ImageLayer2) to handle the status of each image (offset, transparency, etc.).
Image overlay:
Use HTML <div> container as overlay area, which contains two <img> tags.
Control transparency through CSS opacity property, and achieve real-time offset through transform: translate(x, y) or top/left properties.
Real-time rendering:
If more complex real-time effects are required (such as image fusion rather than simple overlay), you can use <canvas> element instead of <img>.
Draw two images through the drawImage method of Canvas API, and set transparency with globalAlpha.
If higher performance requirements or advanced effects (such as pixel-level blending) are required, you can consider WebGL (through Three.js or react-three-fiber).
Parameter control:
Use React's state management (useState or Redux) to dynamically update the transparency and offset parameters of each image.
Use input controls (such as sliders) to let users adjust these parameters in real time, triggering component re-rendering.
3. Recommended tools/frameworks
CSS: Basic overlays and style adjustments without additional plugins.
Canvas API: Native JavaScript API for simple real-time image processing.
Konva.js: A library focused on 2D drawing that can be integrated with React (via react-konva) to facilitate the management of image layers and real-time operations.
Three.js: If WebGL rendering is required, it provides more powerful image processing capabilities and integrates seamlessly with React with react-three-fiber.
React Hooks: Use useState and useEffect to manage state and side effects to ensure real-time updates when parameters change.
4. Methods and steps
Prepare the overlay area: Define a container in the component and set relative positioning.
Load two images: Place the images as separate layers in a container and bind parameters (such as opacity, offset) separately.
Dynamically adjust parameters: Bind user input through React state and update the style of each image or Canvas drawing in real time.
Choose a rendering method:
If you only need a simple overlay, use CSS.
If you need pixel-level control or complex effects, use Canvas or WebGL.
Optimize performance: Use useMemo or useCallback to avoid unnecessary re-rendering, especially when using Canvas.
